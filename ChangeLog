	* ChangeLog: New file.

	* skins/UWOshHomecomingSimple/createTeam.py:
	If Plone 2.1, uses the /object_delete URL on Cancel, else uses the /delete_confirmation URL.

	* content/HomecomingSignupSheet.py:
	Fixed so it correctly handles the case in which a team has been deleted but is still in a time slot.

	* content/isEmailUWOshValidator.py:
	Removed error message referring to Back button.

	* content/isEmailUWOshValidator.py: New file.

	* skins/UWOshHomecomingSimple/createTeam.py:

	* content/HomecomingSignupSheet.py:
	Fixed mutators so they accept blank values now.  Fixed mutator for
	slot 1; it was missing a line of code that the other mutators all had.

	* content/HomecomingSignupSheet.py:
	All fields are searchable.  Specified raw edit accessor so that the
	normal accessor returns a URL to the team.  Corrected the catalog
	query that was not returning all teams (it was returning just the ones
	viewable by the currently logged in member).

	* ../../../../../../Users/Kimtheman/Homecoming/h3.zargo, ../../../../../../Users/Kimtheman/Homecoming/h3.xmi:
	New file.

	* content/HomecomingSignupSheet.py:
	Override title attribute to give it a new label.  Replaced old/bad time slot validators with a single new validator I created ('disallowValueModification'). Fixed type name.

	* ../PloneSurvey/content/Survey.py:
	Fixed translateSavedMessage default value so it doesn't include a CR
	in the message (seems to break the portal_status_message mechanism).
	Also fixed exitSurvey so it handles HTTPS URLs.

	* ../PloneSurvey/content/Survey.py: New file.
